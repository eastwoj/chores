## Core Design Philosophy

### Foundational Principles

Our architectural approach is built on three foundational pillars that prioritize maintainability, testability, and domain clarity:

#### 1. Sandi Metz Principles
- **Small Objects**: Each class should be small enough to understand completely
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have one reason to change
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex behavior through composition
- **Tell, Don't Ask**: Objects should encapsulate their behavior, not expose their data

#### 2. Robert C. Martin's Clean Code
- **Meaningful Names**: Code should read like well-written prose
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Functions and classes should do one thing well
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification

#### 3. Domain-Driven Design
- **Rich Models**: Business logic lives with the data it operates on
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Code should speak the domain language
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear boundaries between different areas of concern

### Why This Matters for Family Chore Management

A family chore tracking system needs to be:
- **Maintainable**: Parents will want to modify rules and add new features
- **Understandable**: The code should reflect how families actually work
- **Testable**: Complex business rules need comprehensive testing
- **Flexible**: Different families have different needs and constraints

Our architectural approach ensures these qualities by keeping business logic close to the data, making dependencies explicit, and creating small, focused objects that can be easily understood and tested.

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: POROs + Rich Models vs Service Objects

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

#### Context
We needed to decide how to organize business logic for complex operations like chore list generation, earnings calculations, and rotation fairness algorithms.

#### Decision Drivers
- Testability and maintainability
- Adherence to SOLID principles
- Code readability and domain clarity
- Future extensibility needs

#### Considered Options

##### Option 1: Service Objects Pattern
```ruby
# Service Object Approach
class ChoreListGenerationService
  def self.call(child, date, interval)
    new(child, date, interval).call
  end
  
  def call
    # Multiple responsibilities:
    # - Generate list
    # - Apply rotation rules
    # - Calculate earnings
    # - Handle age restrictions
    # - Manage persistence
  end
end
```

**Pros:**
- Familiar Rails pattern
- Single entry point for complex operations
- Easy to find business logic

**Cons:**
- Tendency to become God Objects
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- Hard to test individual concerns
- Leads to anemic models
- Encourages procedural programming

##### Option 2: POROs + Rich Models (Chosen)
```ruby
# PORO + Rich Model Approach
class Child < ApplicationRecord
  def generate_chore_list_for(date, interval: :daily)
    generator = ChoreListGenerator.new(self, date, interval)
    generator.generate
  end
end

class ChoreListGenerator
  def initialize(child, date, interval)
    @child = child
    @date = date
    @interval = interval
    @rotation_policy = ChoreRotationPolicy.new(@child.family)
    @earnings_calculator = EarningsCalculator.new(@child.family.family_setting)
  end
  
  def generate
    # Single responsibility: orchestrate list generation
    list = create_chore_list
    add_constant_chores(list)
    add_rotational_chores(list)
    calculate_earnings(list)
    list
  end
end
```

**Pros:**
- Each object has a single responsibility
- Easy to test individual components
- Rich models encapsulate domain behavior
- Composition enables flexibility
- Clear dependency injection

**Cons:**
- More objects to understand initially
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries

#### Decision
We chose **POROs + Rich Models** because it better supports our long-term maintainability goals and creates more testable, flexible code.

#### Consequences
- Business logic is distributed but well-organized
- Testing becomes more granular and reliable
- Models become more expressive of domain concepts
- Requires clear conventions for PORO organization

### ADR-002: PORO Organization Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-09  

#### Context
With POROs handling business logic, we need clear conventions for organizing them.

#### Decision
Organize POROs into four main categories based on their primary responsibility:

1. **Policies/**: Business rule enforcement
2. **Generators/**: Creation and building logic  
3. **Calculators/**: Mathematical computations
4. **Validators/**: Complex validation logic

#### Rationale
This organization follows the Single Responsibility Principle and makes it easy to locate relevant business logic.

## Implementation Patterns

### Rich Model Pattern

Rich models in our system encapsulate domain behavior while maintaining clear interfaces:

```ruby
class Child < ApplicationRecord
  # Domain behavior, not just data access
  def age
    AgeCalculator.new(birth_date).calculate_in_years if birth_date?
  end
  
  def current_period_earnings
    EarningsCalculator.new(self).current_period_total
  end
  
  def can_perform_chore?(chore)
    AgeAppropriatenessPolicy.new(self, chore).allowed?
  end
  
  # Intention-revealing interface
  def activate!
    update!(active: true)
  end
  
  def generate_daily_chore_list
    ChoreListGenerator.new(self, Date.current, :daily).generate
  end
end
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Behavior is co-located with data
- Methods have intention-revealing names
- Complex operations are delegated to POROs
- State changes are explicit and named

### PORO Categories and Responsibilities

#### Policies/ - Business Rule Enforcement
Handle complex business rules that determine what is allowed or how things should behave:

```ruby
class ChoreRotationPolicy
  def initialize(family)
    @family = family
  end
  
  def next_child_for_chore(chore, date)
    # Complex rotation logic ensuring fairness
  end
  
  def rotation_history_for(chore, days_back: 30)
    # Historical analysis for fair distribution
  end
end

class AgeAppropriatenessPolicy  
  def initialize(child, chore)
    @child = child
    @chore = chore
  end
  
  def allowed?
    within_age_range? && meets_difficulty_requirements?
  end
  
  private
  
  def within_age_range?
    return true unless @child.age
    (@chore.min_age.nil? || @child.age >= @chore.min_age) &&
    (@chore.max_age.nil? || @child.age <= @chore.max_age)
  end
end
```

#### Generators/ - Creation Logic
Handle the creation and building of complex objects or structures:

```ruby
class ChoreListGenerator
  def initialize(child, date, interval)
    @child = child
    @date = date
    @interval = interval
  end
  
  def generate
    list = build_chore_list
    populate_with_constant_chores(list)
    populate_with_rotational_chores(list)
    list
  end
  
  private
  
  def build_chore_list
    @child.chore_lists.create!(
      start_date: @date,
      interval: @interval,
      generated_at: Time.current
    )
  end
end

class DailyScheduleGenerator
  def initialize(family, date)
    @family = family
    @date = date
  end
  
  def generate_for_all_children
    @family.active_children.map do |child|
      ChoreListGenerator.new(child, @date, :daily).generate
    end
  end
end
```

#### Calculators/ - Mathematical Computations
Handle all calculations and numerical operations:

```ruby
class EarningsCalculator
  def initialize(child)
    @child = child
  end
  
  def current_period_total
    completed_chores_earnings + approved_extras_earnings
  end
  
  def lifetime_total
    @child.chore_completions.reviewed_satisfactory.sum(:earned_amount) +
    @child.extra_completions.approved.sum(:earned_amount)
  end
  
  def projected_weekly_earnings
    # Complex calculation based on completion patterns
  end
  
  private
  
  def completed_chores_earnings
    @child.chore_completions
          .reviewed_satisfactory
          .where(reviewed_at: current_payout_period)
          .sum(:earned_amount)
  end
end

class CompletionPercentageCalculator
  def initialize(chore_list)
    @chore_list = chore_list
  end
  
  def calculate
    return 0 if total_chores.zero?
    
    (completed_chores.to_f / total_chores * 100).round
  end
  
  private
  
  def completed_chores
    @chore_list.chore_completions.completed.count
  end
  
  def total_chores
    @chore_list.chore_completions.count
  end
end
```

#### Validators/ - Complex Validation Logic
Handle complex validation that goes beyond simple ActiveRecord validations:

```ruby
class ChoreAssignmentValidator
  def initialize(child, chore)
    @child = child
    @chore = chore
  end
  
  def valid?
    errors.empty?
  end
  
  def errors
    @errors ||= collect_validation_errors
  end
  
  private
  
  def collect_validation_errors
    errors = []
    errors << "Child is too young for this chore" unless age_appropriate?
    errors << "Chore conflicts with existing assignments" if conflicts_exist?
    errors << "Child already has maximum daily chores" if exceeds_daily_limit?
    errors
  end
end
```

### Composition and Dependency Injection

Our POROs use constructor injection for dependencies, making them testable and flexible:

```ruby
class ChoreListGenerator
  def initialize(child, date, interval, 
                 rotation_policy: nil, 
                 earnings_calculator: nil,
                 age_policy: nil)
    @child = child
    @date = date
    @interval = interval
    @rotation_policy = rotation_policy || ChoreRotationPolicy.new(@child.family)
    @earnings_calculator = earnings_calculator || EarningsCalculator.new(@child)
    @age_policy = age_policy || AgeAppropriatenessPolicy
  end
  
  # Easy to test with mock dependencies
  # Flexible to swap implementations
end
```

### Domain Events Pattern

Instead of service objects handling side effects, we use domain events:

```ruby
class ChoreCompletion < ApplicationRecord
  def mark_completed!
    update!(status: :completed, completed_at: Time.current)
    DomainEvents.publish(:chore_completed, self)
  end
  
  def mark_reviewed_satisfactory!(reviewer)
    update!(
      status: :reviewed_satisfactory,
      reviewed_at: Time.current,
      reviewed_by: reviewer
    )
    DomainEvents.publish(:chore_approved, self, reviewer)
  end
end

# Event handlers are separate, testable objects
class ChoreCompletionEventHandler
  def handle_chore_completed(completion)
    update_earnings(completion)
    notify_parents_if_needed(completion)
    check_for_completion_streaks(completion)
  end
end
```

### Naming Conventions

#### Classes
- **Models**: Domain nouns (Child, Chore, ChoreList)
- **Policies**: `{Domain}Policy` (ChoreRotationPolicy)
- **Generators**: `{Thing}Generator` (ChoreListGenerator)
- **Calculators**: `{What}Calculator` (EarningsCalculator)
- **Validators**: `{Domain}Validator` (ChoreAssignmentValidator)

#### Methods
- **Actions**: Imperative verbs (`generate`, `calculate`, `validate`)
- **Queries**: Questions (`can_perform?`, `age_appropriate?`, `valid?`)
- **State Changes**: Explicit intent (`activate!`, `mark_completed!`)

#### Files and Directories
- Snake_case for files (`chore_rotation_policy.rb`)
- Plural directories for categories (`policies/`, `calculators/`)
- Clear hierarchy matching logical organization

### Interface Conventions

#### Public Interface Guidelines
```ruby
class ChoreListGenerator
  # Constructor takes required dependencies first, 
  # optional dependencies as keyword arguments
  def initialize(child, date, interval, rotation_policy: nil)
    # ...
  end
  
  # Single primary method with intention-revealing name
  def generate
    # ...
  end
  
  # Query methods return clear boolean or value
  def can_generate?
    # ...
  end
  
  private
  
  # Private methods break down complexity
  def build_base_list
    # ...
  end
end
```

#### Model Interface Guidelines
```ruby
class Child < ApplicationRecord
  # Expose domain behavior, not implementation
  def generate_daily_chore_list
    ChoreListGenerator.new(self, Date.current, :daily).generate
  end
  
  # State changes are explicit and safe
  def activate!
    update!(active: true)
  end
  
  # Queries reveal intent
  def can_perform_chore?(chore)
    AgeAppropriatenessPolicy.new(self, chore).allowed?
  end
end
```

## Testing Philosophy

### Unit Testing Strategy

Our PORO architecture enables focused, isolated unit tests:

#### Testing POROs
```ruby
# POROs are pure objects - easy to test
describe ChoreRotationPolicy do
  let(:family) { create(:family) }
  let(:children) { create_list(:child, 3, family: family) }
  let(:chore) { create(:chore, :rotational, family: family) }
  
  describe "#next_child_for_chore" do
    it "rotates fairly among children" do
      policy = ChoreRotationPolicy.new(family)
      
      # Test the policy in isolation
      first_assignment = policy.next_child_for_chore(chore, Date.current)
      second_assignment = policy.next_child_for_chore(chore, Date.current + 1.day)
      
      expect(first_assignment).not_to eq(second_assignment)
    end
  end
end
```

#### Testing Models with Dependency Injection
```ruby
describe Child do
  describe "#generate_daily_chore_list" do
    it "delegates to ChoreListGenerator" do
      child = create(:child)
      mock_generator = double(ChoreListGenerator)
      allow(ChoreListGenerator).to receive(:new).and_return(mock_generator)
      allow(mock_generator).to receive(:generate).and_return(build(:chore_list))
      
      result = child.generate_daily_chore_list
      
      expect(ChoreListGenerator).to have_received(:new)
        .with(child, Date.current, :daily)
      expect(mock_generator).to have_received(:generate)
    end
  end
end
```

### Integration Testing Strategy

#### Testing Object Composition
```ruby
describe "Chore List Generation Integration" do
  it "creates appropriate chore lists for children" do
    family = create(:family)
    young_child = create(:child, family: family, birth_date: 8.years.ago)
    older_child = create(:child, family: family, birth_date: 12.years.ago)
    
    easy_chore = create(:chore, family: family, difficulty: :easy, max_age: 10)
    hard_chore = create(:chore, family: family, difficulty: :hard, min_age: 11)
    
    young_list = young_child.generate_daily_chore_list
    older_list = older_child.generate_daily_chore_list
    
    expect(young_list.chores).to include(easy_chore)
    expect(young_list.chores).not_to include(hard_chore)
    expect(older_list.chores).to include(hard_chore)
  end
end
```

### Test Organization

```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Before and After - Chore List Generation

#### Before (Service Object Approach)
```ruby
class ChoreListGenerationService
  def self.call(child, date)
    new(child, date).call
  end
  
  def initialize(child, date)
    @child = child
    @date = date
  end
  
  def call
    # Multiple responsibilities in one place
    list = @child.chore_lists.create!(start_date: @date, interval: :daily)
    
    # Age checking logic
    constant_chores = @child.family.chores.constant.select do |chore|
      (@chore.min_age.nil? || @child.age >= @chore.min_age) &&
      (@chore.max_age.nil? || @child.age <= @chore.max_age)
    end
    
    # Rotation logic
    rotational_chores = @child.family.chores.rotational
    previous_assignments = ChoreCompletion.where(child: @child.family.children)
                                         .where("created_at > ?", 7.days.ago)
                                         .group(:chore_id).count
    
    # Complex assignment algorithm...
    
    # Earnings calculation
    constant_chores.each do |chore|
      completion = list.chore_completions.create!(chore: chore, child: @child)
      completion.update!(earned_amount: chore.base_value * family_multiplier)
    end
    
    # Persistence
    list.update!(generated_at: Time.current)
    list
  end
end
```

**Problems:**
- Single class doing too many things
- Hard to test individual concerns
- Difficult to extend or modify
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle

#### After (PORO + Rich Model Approach)
```ruby
# Rich model with clear interface
class Child < ApplicationRecord
  def generate_daily_chore_list
    ChoreListGenerator.new(self, Date.current, :daily).generate
  end
end

# Focused PORO with single responsibility
class ChoreListGenerator
  def initialize(child, date, interval, 
                 age_policy: AgeAppropriatenessPolicy,
                 rotation_policy: nil,
                 earnings_calculator: nil)
    @child = child
    @date = date
    @interval = interval
    @age_policy = age_policy
    @rotation_policy = rotation_policy || ChoreRotationPolicy.new(@child.family)
    @earnings_calculator = earnings_calculator || EarningsCalculator.new(@child)
  end
  
  def generate
    list = build_chore_list
    add_constant_chores(list)
    add_rotational_chores(list)
    finalize_list(list)
  end
  
  private
  
  def build_chore_list
    @child.chore_lists.create!(
      start_date: @date,
      interval: @interval
    )
  end
  
  def add_constant_chores(list)
    constant_chores = @child.constant_chores.select do |chore|
      @age_policy.new(@child, chore).allowed?
    end
    
    constant_chores.each do |chore|
      create_completion(list, chore)
    end
  end
  
  def add_rotational_chores(list)
    assigned_chores = @rotation_policy.assign_rotational_chores_for(@child, @date)
    
    assigned_chores.each do |chore|
      create_completion(list, chore)
    end
  end
  
  def create_completion(list, chore)
    earnings = @earnings_calculator.calculate_for_chore(chore)
    
    list.chore_completions.create!(
      chore: chore,
      child: @child,
      earned_amount: earnings
    )
  end
  
  def finalize_list(list)
    list.update!(generated_at: Time.current)
    list
  end
end

# Separate policy for age appropriateness
class AgeAppropriatenessPolicy
  def initialize(child, chore)
    @child = child
    @chore = chore
  end
  
  def allowed?
    return true unless @child.age
    within_age_range?
  end
  
  private
  
  def within_age_range?
    (@chore.min_age.nil? || @child.age >= @chore.min_age) &&
    (@chore.max_age.nil? || @child.age <= @chore.max_age)
  end
end
```

**Benefits:**
- Each class has a single, clear responsibility
- Easy to test each component in isolation
- Simple to extend (add new policies, calculators)
- Clear dependency injection points
- Follows domain language

### Example 2: Earnings Calculation Evolution

#### Before (Anemic Model)
```ruby
class Child < ApplicationRecord
  # Just data access, no behavior
end

class EarningsService
  def self.calculate_for_child(child)
    # Complex calculation mixed with data access
    base_earnings = child.chore_completions
                         .reviewed_satisfactory
                         .sum(:earned_amount)
    
    # Business rules scattered throughout
    bonus_multiplier = child.family.family_setting.base_chore_value
    streak_bonus = calculate_streak_bonus(child)
    penalty = calculate_penalty(child)
    
    (base_earnings * bonus_multiplier) + streak_bonus - penalty
  end
end
```

#### After (Rich Model + Calculator)
```ruby
class Child < ApplicationRecord
  def current_period_earnings
    EarningsCalculator.new(self).current_period_total
  end
  
  def lifetime_earnings  
    EarningsCalculator.new(self).lifetime_total
  end
  
  def projected_weekly_earnings
    EarningsCalculator.new(self).projected_weekly
  end
end

class EarningsCalculator
  def initialize(child)
    @child = child
    @family_setting = @child.family.family_setting
  end
  
  def current_period_total
    base_earnings + streak_bonus - penalties
  end
  
  def lifetime_total
    @child.chore_completions.reviewed_satisfactory.sum(:earned_amount) +
    @child.extra_completions.approved.sum(:earned_amount)
  end
  
  def projected_weekly
    CompletionPatternAnalyzer.new(@child).average_weekly_earnings
  end
  
  private
  
  def base_earnings
    @child.chore_completions
          .reviewed_satisfactory
          .where(reviewed_at: current_period_range)
          .sum(:earned_amount)
  end
  
  def streak_bonus
    StreakCalculator.new(@child).current_bonus
  end
  
  def penalties
    PenaltyCalculator.new(@child).current_total
  end
end
```

### Example 3: Testing Improvements

#### Before (Hard to Test Service)
```ruby
describe ChoreListGenerationService do
  it "generates appropriate chore lists" do
    # Need to set up entire object graph
    family = create(:family_with_settings)
    child = create(:child, family: family)
    chores = create_list(:chore, 5, family: family)
    
    # Service does everything - hard to test specific behaviors
    result = ChoreListGenerationService.call(child, Date.current)
    
    # Can only test end result, not individual logic
    expect(result.chores.count).to eq(expected_count)
  end
end
```

#### After (Easy to Test Components)
```ruby
describe AgeAppropriatenessPolicy do

## Guidelines for Future Development

### When to Create a New PORO

Create a new PORO when you find yourself writing code that:

1. **Has a clear single responsibility** that doesn't belong in an existing model
2. **Needs complex setup or dependencies** that would clutter a model
3. **Requires isolated testing** of business logic
4. **Might be reused** in multiple contexts
5. **Represents a domain concept** that isn't a persistent entity

### When to Enhance a Model

Enhance a model (don't create a PORO) when:

1. **The behavior directly relates to the model's primary responsibility**
2. **The logic is simple** and doesn't require external dependencies
3. **The method reveals important domain behavior** about that entity
4. **The operation directly changes the model's state**

### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, ask:

#### Single Responsibility
- Does this class/method do one thing well?
- Can I easily explain what this class is responsible for?
- Would I need to change this class for multiple different reasons?

#### Naming and Clarity
- Do the class and method names clearly express intent?
- Would a domain expert understand this code?
- Are the dependencies and requirements obvious?

#### Testing and Dependencies
- Can I easily write a focused unit test for this?
- Are dependencies explicit and injectable?
- Are there any hidden dependencies or side effects?

#### Domain Alignment  
- Does this code reflect how the business actually works?
- Are we using the domain language consistently?
- Are business rules clearly expressed and easily changeable?

### Refactoring Signals

Watch for these signals that indicate a need for refactoring:

#### Extract PORO
- Methods getting longer than 5-7 lines
- Complex conditional logic in models
- Repeated calculation logic
- Business rules scattered across multiple classes

#### Extract Policy
- Multiple `if/elsif` chains for business rules
- Complex validation logic
- Rules that change frequently
- Permission or eligibility checking

#### Extract Calculator
- Mathematical operations mixed with other logic
- Repeated calculation patterns
- Complex formulas that need isolated testing
- Operations that could be optimized separately

### Evolution Strategy

Our architecture should evolve thoughtfully:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic implementations in models
2. **Extract When Needed**: Move to POROs when complexity warrants it
3. **Compose Intelligently**: Build complex behavior through composition
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Maintain high test coverage at all levels
5. **Refactor Regularly**: Keep improving the design as you learn more

### Conclusion

This architectural approach prioritizes:
- **Maintainability** through clear separation of concerns
- **Testability** through dependency injection and small objects
- **Flexibility** through composition and well-defined interfaces
- **Clarity** through domain-driven design and intention-revealing names

By following these patterns and principles, we create a codebase that not only works today but can grow and evolve as our family chore management system becomes more sophisticated.

The key insight is that we're not just building software - we're creating a digital representation of how families work together. Our code should reflect that domain clearly and support the changing needs of the families who use it.
